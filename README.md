# Logbook (logbk)

A journaling application.

## MVP

A CLI that can create journal entries in markdown based on the date and time, similar to the journal in Zed.

**Example:**
`logbk --new-entry`

The folder structure should be `yyyy/mm/dd.md`, and the file should open with the cursor below a new timestamp.

- [X] File path handling
- [X] Walking a directory
