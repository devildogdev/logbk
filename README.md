# Logbook (logbk)

A journaling application.

## MVP

A CLI that can create journal entries in markdown based on the date and time, similar to the journal in Zed.

**Example:**
`logbk --new-entry`

The folder structure should be `yyyy/mm/dd.md`, and the file should open with the cursor below a new timestamp.

## Research

- Opening an editor in Go
- OS module and file handling
- Reading from a config file (Viper)
