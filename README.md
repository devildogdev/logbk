# Logbook (logbk)

A journaling application.

## Inspiration

The journal in Zed.

## MVP

A CLI that can create journal entries in markdown based on the date and time, similar to the journal in Zed.

*For now, I'm only supporting Vim and Neovim, because it's really trivial to open the file with the cursor on the last line, without having to read in the file and counting the lines first.*
